# Shale-Reservoir-DNN

Shale Reservoir Production Performance with Tensorflow-Based Deep Neural Network (DNN).

This module is a Tensorflow-Based DNN Model for hydraulically-fractured-driven production performance prediction of shale reservoirs in the cloud.

It is based on Node.js with option to use either gpu or cpu. 

It can also be adapted for use in the browser with the tfjs-vis library enabled for browser visualization.
