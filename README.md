# Shale-Reservoir-DNN

Shale Reservoir Production Performance with Tensorflow-Based Deep Neural Network (DNN).

This module is a Tensorflow-Based DNN Model for hydraulically-fractured-driven production performance prediction ofin shale reservoirs in the cloud.

It is based on Node.js with option to use either gpu or cpu.
